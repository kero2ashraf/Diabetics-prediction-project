# Diabetics-prediction-project

the summary in this project is to predicting whether the person is having diabetics or not.


python packages :
1) numpy
2) pandas
3) matplotlib.pyplot
4) seaborn
5) from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
6) from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
7) from sklearn.metrics import classification_report,confusion_matrix
8) pickle to save the model

Questions :

1) Give an overview of the data (cleaning and statistical summary )?
2) Do EDA and check if there is any missing values or not ?
3) Make a heatmap about the missing values ?
4) Make a countplot about the outcome?
5) Make a displot between the count and the age?
6) Make a displot between the count and the glucose?
7) Make a jointplot between the glucose and the insulin?
8) Make a displot between the count and the Blood pressure?
9) Make a displot between the count and the BMI?
10) Make a jointplot between the Skin thickness and the BMI?
11) Make a boxplot to see the relationship between insulin and outcome?
12) Make a boxplot about the insulin?
13) Get the correlation of the data and make a heatmap on it?
14) Make a pairplot about the whole data?
15) Make a subplots ( boxplot) between the age and the BMI?
16) Train the model by using logistic regression?
17) Get a classification report about the y test and the prediction?
18) Get the train and the test accuracy ?
19) Make a heatmap about the predicted label and the actual label?
20) Save the model?
